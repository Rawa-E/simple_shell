SIMPLE SHELL PROJECT
This project is a simple shell that operates like a linux terminal.
The user enters the command they want. The program goes back to the path
if the command is found within the path,its gonna be excuted using exceve in the child process.
if the command is not found within the path, an error message would be display in the terminal.

The program was implemented using C programming language.
We used system call fuctionalities such as:
-exceve()
-fork()
-getline()
and etc...

We used fuctionalities such as:
-malloc()
-free()
-strcpy()
-strdup()
and etc...
